         <section class="about">
                <p>I'm a third year Design student at Concordia University. I mainly enjoy producing illustrative graphics for print. A large focus of my work is colors and characters. I like to fiddle with color palettes and create sceneries that are meaningful and tell somewhat of a story. I think art is a great tool, especially in these times where speaking out against injustice is important. Stay tuned for more design projects as I embark on my journey to learn web design.</p>
