            <h1>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls of Canada</h1>
            <p>Genocide, as we know, it has often been quite a loud phenomenon. We can think of multiple instances classified as genocide such as the Armenian Massacre of 1915  and the extermination of the Jews during World War II, to name a few. These types of genocide are loud, evident, in your face and they cause obvious countless losses. But there’s another type of destruction; a slow and silent type of genocide. This kind can go unnoticed for decades. We are presently in the middle of one such thing. I’m describing the rising count of missing and murdered indigenous women, right here in Canada. This phenomenon has recently been described as such: a genocide. Justly so, because we are witnessing the destruction of a ethnic group of people, strategically disappearing slowly, so as not to be labeled a crisis. Although a bit late, there have now been a few efforts made to raise awareness to this on-going tragedy. This essay will discuss the facts, statistics and history behind this injustice.</p>
            <p>In 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police completed a report about the incidents concerning Aborginal female homicides and unresolved missing Aboriginal female investigations. The report included the various key factors that define the types of homicide, the victim demographic and likely perpetrators. It also included numbers and statistics of the female population that go missing/are victims of homicide. According to the report, there were a total of 1,181 victims between 1980 and 2012: 164 missing and 1,017 homicide victims (RCMP 7).  In 2011, Aboriginal women represented about 4.3% of the female population in Canada, yet they made up 11.3% of the total number of missing females (RCMP 8). The number of non-Aboriginal female homicide victims has been declining and yet the number of Aboriginal female victims has stayed constant (RCMP 10). Victims usually know the perpetrators but Aboriginal women have a higher chance of being murdered by a mere acquaintance or stranger (RCMP 12). At least a third of the victims (32%) were violently and physically beaten to death. This is the most frequent cause of death and is twice the number than that of non-Aboriginal women (RCMP 10). These rates of violence are disproportionately high. According to the Native Women’s Association of Canada, in 2010, only half (53%) of the murder cases in their database led to homicide charges. This number is incredibly low in comparison to the national clearance rate for homicides in Canada, which were reported to be about 84% (NWAC 4). These numbers are quite shocking and even so, are largely disputed (Brant). Firstly,this report only included cases within the RCMP’s jurisdiction which means that the numbers excluded cases from Ontario and Québec (Brant). Secondly, the RCMP report acknowledged almost 1200 victims in a span of 32 years but Indigenous women’s groups have reported that the number of missing and murdered women had to be over 4,000 (Brant). This discrepancy is due to the under-reporting of missing and murdered indigenous women as well as the lack of an effective database to keep track of these reports (Brant).  According to the 2004 General Social Survey “Indigenous women 15 years and older were 3.5 times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women” and “Between 1997 and 2000, the homicide rate for Indigenous women was nearly seven times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous women.” (Brant)</p>
            <p>Now that we have an understanding of the numbers and the discrepancies between reports, we can now analyse why these numbers are what they are. Why is there a consistent and disproportionate rate of violence against indigenous women in Canada? There is a deeply rooted historical context and reason for these numbers. The history of settlers and colonialism in Canada has led to “the ongoing racialization and sexualization of Indigenous women” (Brant). Historically, Indigenous women were over sexualized, these racial stereotypes still permeate in our society today. The latest example of this stereotype happened not that long ago. In late September, Joyce Echaquan died at a Joliette hospital because the staff ignored her pleas and her health chart which indicated a heart condition. She was shamed for her life choices and was degraded while racial slurs were uttered to her. One nurse even said “[s]he’s good at having sex, more than anything else” (Brant). This is a blatant and contemporary example of how the racialization and sexualization of Indigenous women can lead to their endangerment and death. Settler colonialist attitudes have long persisted in Canada and have influenced the abuse of Indigenous people. Examples of the effects of colonialism also include legally sanctioned policies such as the Indian Act and the residential schools (that are notoriously underfunded, lack resources and are poorly maintained), the pass system and forced sterilization (Brant). In her Britannica article, Brant explains that “Indigenous women are both overpoliced and under protected. Amnesty documented the social and economic marginalization of Indigenous women, noting that racism, poverty and marginalization, along with a lack of police protection, heighten Indigenous women’s vulnerability to violence” (Brant). What this means is that although these women are often racially profiled but lack any form of adequate protection from our law enforcement. These women lack the resources that non-Indigenous women have access to. This is an intersectional problem. These women have to simultaneously handle the impacts of misogyny and racism. It's an intersection that puts them at higher risk than white females. Key factors that have led to the continuation of this cycle of tragedy and violence against Indigenous women include this intersectionality as well as the disruption of Indigenous societies caused by “ the historic and ongoing mass removal of children from Indigenous families and communities” (Brant). Also, the inadequate police response to the mounting violence against indigenous women (made evident by their handling of these cases) (Brant).</p>
            <p>Knowing these facts, it is our responsibility as Canadians and humans to right this wrong. We can do this by raising awareness to this issue. We can attend marches, vigil, watch documentaries, support our local shelters, etc. We have often prided ourselves with being a “nice” and “polite” nation. But we have done many wrongs to the Indigenous communities. We must acknowledge this tragedy and seek justice for it.</p>
