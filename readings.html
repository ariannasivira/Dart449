                <span>As We May Think</span>
                <p>
                    Bush’s analysis of our scientific advancements are quite eloquent. He speaks of technology with such ease and with such complexity that the reader can easily forget that this article was published in 1945. He describes technological usefulness to science as something that must continually store and extend our record of ideas. He states that because of science, we now have a swift way of communicating with one another. This innovation has made it possible for us, as humans to keep our history and records logged so that knowledge of our race can easily be passed down and evolved throughout our existence. Bush goes on quite a lengthy path to explain the intricate details of our technologies and how we can envision and simplify the connections and human labour in our future creations. If Bush could catch a glimpse of what science and technological advancements have led to in the 21st century, I think he would be quite astounded at how far we’ve come in such a short amount of time. All kinds of history and information is available to almost all, quite literally at our fingertips. We have progressed immensely since the publication of this article. The issue now lies with how records are portrayed. Much of our information does not encompass our experience as a human race. The lense with which man has recorded our human history has  largely been favoring the white male experience. As a race, our issue is not now with how easily we can keep track of our records but how we can expand them to be inclusive of all types of human experiences. A big issue that I had with Bush’s explanations and ideas was that the way he writes is not comprehensible to all. He goes on and on about science and technology and how many technical parts of machinery interconnect and affect each other with very precise and technical vocabulary that is not understandable to all. I had a hard time trying to summarize Bush’s message into a single paragraph, let alone a single sentence.

            <span>Writing the History of the Internet</span>
            <p>
                Rosenzweig does a great job at exploring all facets of the history of the internet. It’s quite interesting to note that unlike many other inventions, the creation of the internet can’t exactly be attributed to a single person. As he states, there are different sources and broad social contexts that led up to its creation. Personally, I knew very little of the origins of the internet so it’s connection to the military was a surprising discovery. It’s quite terrifying, actually, to know that what we now use freely in our everyday life to communicate and gather information, had military involvement. Another point that I thought was quite intelligent was the decentralization of communication. It made for a more stable and more effective network. Rosenzweig points this out in page 1532 when he explains that the destruction of switching points could bring down the entire structure. What I enjoy about this particular reading is that the author really takes his time to explore the different facets of all contributors. I really enjoyed when Rosenzweig moved away from the bureaucratic side of the ARPANET, where he talks in depth about the cold war and the close relation between the computerization of society and the computerization of war,  and moves on to the students and the hackers that refined it and made it more accessible to all. He mentions Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis that developed the “Unix” operating system that helped them exchange files, which eventually led to the creation of email in 1972 by Ray Tomlinson. I couldn't help but tie this text to last week’s “As We May Think” and be astounded at how Bush’s arguments for more rapid and tech-led communication has essentially become a concrete invention in this text.

        <span>Virtual Revolution, The Great Leveling?</span>
        <p>
            This week’s documentary questions the freedom and equality that the internet promises. I was shocked and impressed to see the big players of the internet world actually comment on the history and benefits of the internet. I think the interviewer asks the right questions. The virtual revolution really did start out as a medium for people to share ideas and content; it was a free space for users to do as they please. However as the potential of the internet grew, so did it’s potential for commercial spaces and monetization. I’m torn because I agree that in an ideal world, everyone should be allowed access to the internet and should be allowed to share all kinds of things (with the exception of illegal items and activities) without repercussions. But I also think that workers, such as software developers should get paid for their work. There is a fine line however, between paying someone fairly and making the rich richer. I’m not going to pretend that I’ve never pirated movies, music or software. But my reasons for doing so was always because I couldn’t afford those things as an unemployed student but also because I don’t like giving my money to people who are already incredibly rich. I’m really thankful that unlike Bill Gates, Tim Berners-Lee offered his software to the world for free. If he had monetized his invention, I really don’t know where we would be today. Maybe it would have been pirated like so many other things. I think the internet came from a place of good intentions for freedom, equality and sharing but has now become a monetized platform that necessitates equipment that can’t be afforded by all people around the globe. It is not a fair platform where all voices can be heard.

    <span>Is Google Making Us Stupid?</span>
    <p>
        This article has resonated with me most out of all assigned readings. Much like Carr, I was an avid reader in my child and teen years, but my attention span has been getting shorter and shorter as the years have gone by. One could easily just assume it's due to aging but no, Carr speculates that it’s because of the internet. The idea is not as far fetched as you would think, in fact it makes quite a lot of sense. The brain is a very adaptable and flexible organ. It digests information with such speed; neuron connecting to neuron at a pace that is much faster than the net. I’ve experienced the inability to get through books, and even articles as Carr discussed. Having spent a lot of my summer on the newest platform (Tiktok), my brain got used to processing information in 15 seconds to about a minute. It’s insane because even in the first 3 seconds, I can tell whether or not I will enjoy the content or not. I’ve also seen this same experience when my friends use Tinder. They swipe and swipe without even giving a second thought. They analyse their compatibility or the attractiveness of a stranger in a matter of fractions of a second. Going from that high speedy delivery of information to reading academic texts was very hard at first. Like Carr mentioned, most of the time I end up skimming the texts rather than fully reading them. Now, reading feels heavy and long and I end up thinking about taking a break to check my phone. Maybe Carr is right, maybe we are on track to becoming pancake people and AI will surpass us. He mentions that haunting scene from 2001 but I never actually got past the first 20 minutes of the movies (with the monkeys discovering fire). That only goes to prove his point even further, I couldn’t vene finish a movie.
